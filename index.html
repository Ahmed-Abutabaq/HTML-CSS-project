            <h1>About <span> Me </span></h1>
            <h5><span>Ahmed</span>ABUTABAQ</h5>
            <p>
                As a Mechanical Engineer with 24 years old and based in North Gaza, I have been working as a research assistant at the Center for Excellence in Renewable Energy (CERE) at the Islamic University of Gaza. 
                In addition to my work in the field of renewable energy, I have also been interested in programming and have been teaching myself various programming languages in my free time. 
                I believe that programming skills can open up many opportunities for me, including the ability to work as a freelancer. 
                I am excited about the potential that programming has to offer, and look forward to developing my skills further in the future.
                By learning programming, you can develop various skill set and opportunity in different career path 
                such as web development, software development, data analysis, and even machine learning, which could open up wide range of job opportunities, such as freelance work, remote work, and self-employment.
